[SS] It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. [SS] The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater. [SS] Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle. [SS] Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation. [SS] The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (19421945). [SS] The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. [PP] [SS] The following Union Army units and commanders fought in the Seven Days Battles (from June 25 to July 1, 1862) of the American Civil War. [SS] Order of battle compiled from the army organization-return of casualties during the battle and the reports. [SS] The Confederate order of battle is listed separately. [PP] [SS] The Battle of Cross Keys was fought on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. [SS] Together, the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic the following day were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. [PP] [SS] The Battle of Gaines's Mill, sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River, took place on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia, as the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) of the American Civil War. [SS] Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River. [SS] There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp. [SS] Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. [SS] Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division [SS] [PP] [SS] Savage's Station was the wartime name of a supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War. [SS] Savage's Station was located in Henrico County, Virginia on what was the Richmond and York River Railroad, however the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, the railroad track's current owner, has no record that an actual train station or station house ever existed on the property. [SS] A farmhouse is known to have been located in a copse of trees on a small knoll next to the railroad track and is visible in several period drawings and photographs made during the war. [SS] The house served as the nucleus of a large field hospital during and after the battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles. [SS] The house also functioned as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862. [SS] Although the house [SS] [SS] [SS] [SS] [PP] [SS] The Battle of Port Republic was fought on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. [SS] Port Republic was a fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the most costly battle fought by Jackson's Army of the Valley during its campaign. [SS] Together, the battles of Cross Keys (fought the previous day) and Port Republic were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia.

{"question_id": "5ac249bd55429951e9e68528", "answer": "supply chain efficiencies and logistical models within the blood distribution industry. [SS] The companys goal is to redistribute blood supplies, increase competition in the distribution market, and lower the cost of health care in the United States. [SS] General Blood was established by creating an online marketplace where medical centers are able to post excess quantities of blood for sale and place orders to replenish blood supplies. [PP] [SS] The circular flow of income or circular flow is a model of the economy in which the major exchanges are represented as flows of money, goods and services, etc. between economic agents. [SS] The flows of money and goods exchanged in a closed circuit correspond in value, but run in the opposite direction. [SS] The circular flow analysis is the basis of national accounts and hence of macroeconomics. [PP] [SS] An open economy is an economy in which there are economic activities between the domestic community and outside. [SS] People and even businesses can trade in goods and services with other people and businesses in the international community, and funds can flow as investments across the border. [SS] Trade can take the form of managerial exchange, technology transfers, and all kinds of goods and services. [SS] (However, certain exceptions exist that cannot be exchanged; the railway services of a country, for example, cannot be traded with another country to avail the service.) [PP] [SS] A vascular bypass (or vascular graft) is a surgical procedure performed to redirect blood flow from one area to another by reconnecting blood vessels. [SS] Often, this is done to bypass around a diseased artery, from an area of normal blood flow to another relatively normal area. [SS] It is commonly performed due to inadequate blood flow (ischemia) caused by atherosclerosis, as a part of organ transplantation, or for vascular access in hemodialysis. [SS] In general, someone's own vein (autograft) is the preferred graft material (or conduit) for a vascular bypass, but other types of grafts such as polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron), or a different person's vein (allograft) are also commonly used. [SS] Arteries can also serve as vascular grafts. [SS] A surgeon [PP] [SS] Sales taxes in the United States are taxes placed on the sale or lease of goods and services in the United States. [SS] In the United States, sales tax is governed at the state level and no national general sales tax exists. [SS] Forty-five states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam impose general sales taxes that apply to the sale or lease of most goods and some services, and states also may levy selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods or services. [SS] States may also delegate to local governments the authority to impose additional general or selective sales taxes. [PP] [SS] Social inequality occurs when resources in a given society are distributed unevenly, typically through norms of allocation, that engender specific patterns along lines of socially defined categories of persons. [SS] It is the differentiation preference of access of social goods in the society brought about by power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and class. [SS] The social rights include labor market, the source of income, health care, and freedom of speech, education, political representation, and participation. [SS] Social inequality linked to Economic inequality, usually described on the basis of the unequal distribution of income or wealth, is a frequently studied type of social inequality. [SS] Though the disciplines of economics and sociology generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality, both fields are actively involved in researching this inequality. [SS] However, social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to social status. [SS] Norms of [PP] [SS] A straw purchase or nominee purchase is any purchase wherein an agent agrees to acquire a good or service for someone who is unable or unwilling to purchase the good or service themselves, and the agent transfers the goods or services to that person after purchasing them. [SS] In general, straw purchases are legal except in cases where the ultimate receiver of goods or services uses those goods or services in the commission of a crime with the prior knowledge of the straw purchaser, or if the ultimate possessor is not legally able to purchase the goods or services. [SS] In some jurisdictions, straw purchases are legal although the end user is not legally able to purchase the good or service himself or herself. [PP] [SS] Bone marrow failure occurs in individuals who produce an insufficient amount of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. [SS] Red blood cells transport oxygen to be distributed throughout the bodys tissue. [SS] White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. [SS] Bone marrow also contains platelets, which trigger clotting, and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. [PP] [SS] International business comprises all international trades services or investments (bonds, stocks) conducted by both the private and public sectors that take place between two or more countries beyond their political boundaries. [SS] The term \"international business\" refers to all those business activities which involve cross-border transactions of goods, services, and resources between two or more nations. [SS] Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. [SS] International business can also be referred to as globalization. [SS] Globalization is the shift toward a more integrated and interdependent economy. [SS] In order to conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to separate national markets into one huge global marketplace. [SS] Two macro factors underline the trend of greater globalization. [SS] The first is falling of barriers to make cross-border trade easier such as the free flow of goods and services, and capital, and the second factor is [PP] [SS] In commerce, supply chain management", "answer_confidence": 0.18061965703964233, "supporting_paragraphs": ["General Blood", "Supply chain management"], "supporting_sentences": [["General Blood", 0], ["Supply chain management", 0]]}

[SS] The hotel opened at the time that the railway link with Kendal was established in 1847. [SS] It overlooks the A591 road. [PP] [SS] North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe is a light rail and commuter rail station in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States served by the Green Line of Utah Transit Authority's (UTA) TRAX light rail system and by the \"FrontRunner\", UTA's commuter rail train that operates along the Wasatch Front with service from Pleasant View in northern Weber County through Ogden, Davis County, Salt Lake City, and Salt Lake County to Provo in central Utah County.

[SS] It has a population of 8,245 increasing to 8,359 at the 2011 Census, and lies about half a mile (1 km) away from the lake, Windermere. [SS] Although the town Windermere does not touch the lake (it took the name of the lake when the railway line was built in 1847 and the station was called \"Windermere\"), it has now grown together with the older lakeside town of Bowness-on-Windermere, though the two retain distinguishable town centres.

Thompson, has attracted attention from mainstream scholars who have criticized the views given on archeology and describe it as pseudoscientific. [PP] [SS] Falling in Love With Hominids is a collection of short stories by Nalo Hopkinson. [SS] One of the stories in this collection, \"Flying Lessons\" is a new story, while other stories had been written and published in the decade proceeding publication of the collection. [SS] In the introduction to the collection, Hopkinson explains the double meaning behind its title. [SS] Partially derived from a phrase written by science fiction author Cordwainer Smith, \"falling in love with hominids\" also describes her own feelings about the human race. [SS] When she was younger, Hopkinson writes that she hated human beings, but has grown to love and be fascinated by the human race over the intervening years. [SS] The paradox of people who are \"capable simultaneously of such great good and such horrifying evil\" runs throughout the stories brought together in the collection. [PP] [SS] Gilgamesh the immortal is an Argentine comic book created by Lucho Olivera and published by Editorial Columba. [SS] It is freely based in the famous \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", and features Gilgamesh as an ancient king that met an alien who turned him into immortal by using his advanced technology. [SS] The story of the character spans from that point to the death of the human race during an atomic holocaust, a space journey, the establishment of the human race on another planet and his eventual return to earth. [SS] The comic book was first published in 1969. [PP] [SS] Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race is a 1993 book by Michael A. Cremo and Richard L.

{"question_id": "5a747a9a55429929fddd8444", "answer": "Paul Hindemith ( ) (16 November 1895 28 December 1963) was a prolific German composer, violist, violinist, teacher and conductor. [SS] Notable compositions include his song cycle \"Das Marienleben\" (1923), \"Der Schwanendreher\" for viola and orchestra (1935), and opera \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938). [SS] Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is likely the \"Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber\", written in 1943. [PP] [SS] Shhrazade is the title of two works by the French composer Maurice Ravel. [SS] Both have their origins in the composer's fascination with Scheherazade, the heroine and narrator of \"The Arabian Nights\". [SS] The first work, an overture (1898), Ravel's earliest surviving orchestral piece, was not well received at its premiere and has not subsequently been among his most popular works. [SS] Four years later he had a much greater success with a song cycle with the same title, which has remained a standard repertoire piece and has been recorded many times. [PP] [SS] Louise Ochs was a Franco-Belgian sculptor born in the suburbs of Brussels, Belgium, at the end of the 19th century. [SS] Initially she studied under Constantin Meunier. [SS] She moved to Paris and exhibited her works at the Salon de la Socit Nationale des Beaux-Arts between 1905 and 1914 and at the Salon de la Libre Esthtique from 1906 to 1912. [SS] On the occasion of her exhibit at the Galerie Boutet de Monvel in 1912, the poet and writer Guillaume Apollinaire praised her work. [SS] Examples of her art include a bust of Maurice Ravel which now is exhibited at the composer Maurice Ravel museum in the town of Montfort-L'Amaury, outside of Paris, and a bronze mask of composer Claude Debussy which was exhibited at the Muse d'Orsay October 2008 to February 2009. [SS] A bronze plaque entitled \"Challenge de [PP] [SS] Histoires naturelles (\"Natural Histories\") is a song cycle by Maurice Ravel, composed in 1906. [SS] It sets five poems by Jules Renard to music for voice and piano. [SS] Ravel's pupil Manuel Rosenthal created a version for voice and orchestra. [SS] The cycle is dedicated to the mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori, who gave the first performance, accompanied by the composer, on 12 January 1907. [PP] [SS] The \"Konzertmusik\" for Brass and String Orchestra, Op. 50, is a work by Paul Hindemith, composed in 1930. [SS] It was one of a large group of pieces commissioned for the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra by its music director, Serge Koussevitzky (others include the Piano Concerto in G major by Maurice Ravel, the Symphony of Psalms by Igor Stravinsky, and Aaron Copland's \"Symphonic Ode\"). [SS] Koussevitzky conducted the premiere of Hindemith's work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on 3 April 1931. [PP] [SS] The international Paul Hindemith Prize promotes outstanding contemporary composers within the framework of the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival (SHMF). [SS] The award commemorates the musical pedagogy of Paul Hindemith, who wrote the composition \"Plner Musiktag\" in 1932 on behalf of the Staatliche Bildungsanstalt Pln. [SS] The music prize is endowed with 20,000 and goes together with a composition commission. [SS] The prize is presented annually by the Hindemith Foundation in Blonay (Switzerland), the Walter and Kthe Busche Foundation, the Rudolf and Erika Koch Foundation, the Gerhard Trede Foundation, the Franz Wirth Memorial Trust and the Cultural Office of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg since 1990. [SS] Since 2010, the winner is found partly by a composition competition. [SS] The work of the prize winner is to be premiered within the framework of the Schles [PP] [SS] Pavane pour une infante dfunte (\"Pavane for a Dead Infanta\") is a well-known piece written for solo piano by the French composer Maurice Ravel in 1899 when he was studying composition at the Conservatoire de Paris under Gabriel Faur. [SS] Ravel also published an orchestrated version of the \"Pavane\" in 1910; it is scored for two flutes, oboe, two clarinets (in B-flat), two bassoons, two horns, harp, and strings. [SS] A typical performance of the piece lasts between six and seven minutes. [SS] It is widely considered a masterpiece.

{"question_id": "5a8f54215542992414482a54", "answer": "sixth model generation of the BMW 7 Series. [SS] It was revealed on June 10, 2015 at BMW's headquarters in Munich. [SS] An official public reveal took place at the 2015 International Motor Show Germany. [PP] [SS] The BMW X1 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed worldwide by BMW since 2009. [SS] The first generation model, based on the BMW 3 Series, was available with rear-wheel-drive (\"sDrive\") and all-wheel-drive (\"xDrive\") configurations. [SS] The second generation, based on BMW's compact UKL platform, is available with front-wheel-drive (\"sDrive\") and all-wheel-drive (\"xDrive\"). [PP] [SS] BMW xDrive is the marketing name for the all-wheel drive system found on the BMW X1, X3, X4, X5, and X6 crossover sport activity vehicles. [SS] It is also optional on the 1 Series (2012present), 2 series (2015-present), 3 Series (2000present), 4 Series (2014), 5 Series (2005present), 6 Series (2012present), and 7 Series (2010present). [PP] [SS] Formula LO, previously known formally as LO Formel Lista Junior, was an open wheel racing series based in mainland Europe, which often ran as a support series to the Formula Renault 2.0 Switzerland. [SS] The first season was in 2000 and is based in Switzerland, and governed by the country's National Motorsport Authority. [SS] Because motorsports are essentially banned in Switzerland, the racing takes place on circuits in surrounding nations such as France, Italy and Germany. [SS] Many of the drivers go on to race in Formula Three and especially to the closely linked Formula BMW series. [SS] The series is often considered to be in competition with the German-based ADAC Formel Masters, which formed in 2008. [SS] It is named after its primary sponsor, Lista Office, owned by Swiss racing driver Fredy Lienhard. [PP] [SS] The BMW 8 Series is a Grand Tourer built by BMW from 1989 to 1999 powered by either a V8 or V12 engine. [SS] While it did supplant the original E24 based 6 Series in 1991, a common misconception is that the 8 Series was developed as a successor. [SS] It was actually in an entirely new model class aimed at a different market, with a substantially higher price and performance than the 6 Series. [SS] In 1999, BMW discontinued the 8 Series because of low demand and sales. [SS] However, in 2017, BMW announced a new generation to be available from 2018 and previewed it with the BMW Concept 8 Series. [SS] BMW also confirmed that the second generation will get an M version. [PP] [SS] The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury crossover produced by BMW. [SS] The first generation of the X5, with the chassis code E53, made its debut in 1999. [SS] It was BMW's first SUV and it also featured all-wheel drive and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. [SS] In 2006, the second generation X5 was launched, known internally as the E70, featuring the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic transmission, and in 2009 the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model. [PP] [SS] The BMW 5 Series is a mid-size luxury car manufactured by BMW since 1972. [SS] It is the successor to the New Class Sedans and is currently in its seventh generation", "answer_confidence": 0.46020400524139404, "supporting_paragraphs": ["BMW xDrive", "BMW 5 Series"], "supporting_sentences": [["BMW xDrive", 0], ["BMW xDrive", 1]]}

{"question_id": "5ab259b25542993be8fa98de", "answer": "battlefield of Europe\" or the \"cockpit of Europe\". [SS] It is also remarkable as a European nation which contains, and is divided by, a language boundary between Latin-derived French and Germanic Dutch. [PP] [SS] A locative adverb is a type of adverb that refers to a location or to a combination of a location and a relation to that location. [SS] Generally, a locative adverb is semantically equivalent to a prepositional phrase involving a locative or directional preposition. [SS] In English, for example, \"homeward\" is a locative adverb, specifying a location \"home\" and a relation \"toward\" (in this case a direction), and is equivalent to the phrase \"toward home\". [SS] The relation need not be a direction, as it can be any relation that can be specified by a locational preposition such as \"to\", \"from\", \"in\", \"at\", \"near\", \"toward\", or \"away from\". [SS] For example, the word \"home\" [PP] [SS] Divers hands (or more rarely dyvers hands), is an archaic phrase used to refer to a project that has been contributed to by many people. \" [SS] Divers\" is a word of Latin origin (\"diversus\") that is still commonly used in modern French language; it literally means \"many and varied\". [SS] This usage of the word \"Divers\" can be found in the Bible and other older texts, but it is not commonly used in modern English. [SS] The phrase is still used to refer to the authorship of plays, essay collections, and short story collections by multiple authors. [PP] [SS] The Latin phrase in saecula saeculorum expresses the idea of eternity and is literally translated as \"unto the ages of ages.\" [SS] The phrase is the Vulgate translation of the New Testament, translating the original Koine Greek phrase \" \" (\"eis tos aionas ton ainn\") e.g. Phillippians 4:20. [SS] The phrase expresses the eternal duration of God's attributes. [SS] Other variations of the phrase are found in e.g. Eph 3:21 as , , here referring to the glory of God, the Father, and can be translated as \"from all generations for ever and ever, amen\". [PP] [SS] A cockfight is a blood sport between two cocks, or gamecocks, held in a ring called a cockpit. [SS] The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back 6,000 years. [SS] The first documented use of the \"word\" gamecock", "answer_confidence": 0.2780619263648987, "supporting_paragraphs": ["Cockfight", "History of Belgium"], "supporting_sentences": [["History of Belgium", 0], ["History of Belgium", 3], ["Cockfight", 0], ["Cockfight", 2]]}

[PP] [SS] The Magic Labyrinth (1980) is a science fiction novel, the fourth in the series of Riverworld books by Philip Jos Farmer.

{"question_id": "5ae7a6da5542994a481bbdb9", "answer": "2007 documentary film about fans of the New York Mets. [SS] Directed, produced and edited by Katherine Foronjy and Joseph Coburn, the film follows a wide variety of fans over the course of the 2005 and 2006 baseball seasons, culminating in an exciting 7 game series against the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS. [SS] \"Mathematically Alive\" shows the emotional attachment that fans develop for their team and how it can be the source of great joy or tremendous sadness. [SS] In addition to the hundreds of fans interviewed for the film, Coburn and Foronjy also caught up with former Mets players Bud Harrelson, Ron Swoboda, Ed Charles, Tim Teuffel and legendary broadcaster Ralph Kiner. [SS] The filmmakers also interviewed Dr. Daniel Wann, a sports psychology professor at Murray State University, who explains many of the psychological characteristics sports fans share. [SS] [SS] [PP] [SS] Charles Ray Knight (born December 28, 1952) is an American former right-handed Major League Baseball corner infielder best remembered for his time with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets. [SS] Originally drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the tenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, he is likely best remembered to Reds fans as the man who replaced Pete Rose at third base, whereas Mets fans remember Knight as the man who scored the winning run of game six of the 1986 World Series and the MVP of that series. [SS] He is now a studio analyst and occasional game analyst for MASN's coverage of the Washington Nationals. [PP] [SS] City Bus Simulator is a series of games created by TML Studios. [SS] There are two games in the series, \"City Bus Simulator New York 2010\" and \"City Bus Simulator Munich\" (also referred to as \"City Bus Simulator 2\", \"CBS2\" and its German name \"City Bus Simulator Mnchen\"). [PP] [SS] MTA Bus Time, stylized as BusTime, is a Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI) automatic vehicle location (AVL) and passenger information system provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York City for customers of its bus operations under the New York City Bus and MTA Bus Company brands. [SS] First tested in late 2010 and officially launched in early 2011, MTA Bus Time was installed in all MTA bus routes in New York City by 2014. [SS] The software uses GPS technology equipped in buses to relay real-time location information to passengers via internet-enabled devices (particularly smartphones), SMS messages, or countdown clocks installed at bus stops. [SS] Similar to the technology used for countdown clocks found in the New York City Subway system (called Subway Time), the project is the successor to multiple attempts by the MTA to install positioning technology for buses, going back to 1996. [PP] [SS] The Crosstown Line is a public transit line in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, running along Van Brunt Street and Manhattan Avenue between Red Hook and Long Island City, Queens. [SS] Originally a streetcar line, it is now the B61 and the B62 bus routes. [SS] The northern section, the B62, is operated by MTA New York City Bus' Grand Avenue Depot in Maspeth, Queens, and the southern section is the B61, operated by MTA New York City Bus' Jackie Gleason Depot in Sunset Park. [SS] The entire route was a single line, the B61, until January 3, 2010; the B62 was previously a separate, parallel route between Downtown Brooklyn and Greenpoint, now part of the B43 route. [SS] The streetcar line, B61 and the original B62 previously operated from the now-closed Crosstown Depot in Greenpoint.

{"question_id": "5ac509e95542994611c8b333", "answer": "Dance moves or dance steps (more complex dance moves are called dance patterns, dance figures, dance movements, or dance variations) are usually isolated, defined, and organized so that beginning dancers can learn and use them independently of each other. [SS] However, more complex movements are influenced by musicality and lyrical relevance to express emotions or refer to a message. [PP] [SS] Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is the process of inducing knowledge in a subject by increasing neural activation in predetermined regions of interest in the brain, such as their visual cortex. [SS] This is achieved by measuring neural activity in these regions via functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), comparing this to the ideal pattern of neural activation in these regions (for the intended purpose), and giving subjects feedback on how close their current pattern of neural activity is to the ideal pattern. [SS] Without explicit knowledge of what they are supposed to be doing or thinking about, over time participants learn to induce this ideal pattern of neural activation. [SS] Corresponding to this, their 'knowledge' or way of thinking has been found to change accordingly. [PP] [SS] Cis AB is a rare mutation in the ABO gene which complicates the basic inheritance pattern and blood-transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing. [SS] There are different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles that change several amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A). [SS] A single change in ABO gene DNA could reverse type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme will produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B and A2B3)). [SS] The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing Glycine (type A) to Alanine (type B).

{"question_id": "5ab9625e55429970cfb8eaa9", "answer": "Hennepin County. [SS] The origin and growth of the city was spurred by the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills. [PP] [SS] Irish in Saint Paul, Minnesota have played an integral part in the founding and the growth of the city. [SS] The first Irish to settle in Saint Paul were three soldiers from Fort Snelling who were natives of Ireland. [SS] They became the first settlers in the area of downtown Saint Paul. [SS] Helped by Archbishop John Ireland, thousands of Irish emigrated from Ireland and Eastern cities in the United States to Minnesota; the majority settled in Saint Paul. [PP] [SS] USS \"Fort Snelling\" (LSD-30) was a \"Thomaston\"-class dock landing ship of the United States Navy. [SS] She was named for Fort Snelling at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, for many years the northernmost military post in the land of the Sioux and Chippewa. [SS] She was the second ship assigned that name, but the construction of \"Fort Snelling\"(LSD-23) was canceled on 17 August 1945. [PP] [SS] West Seventh is a neighborhood in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. [SS] This area is colloquially known as the West End, and is not to be confused with the West Side, a different neighborhood. [SS] The West End lies at the base of Summit Hill and along the western bluffs of the Mississippi River, spanning the entire length of West Seventh Street, or Old Fort Road; it is also known as the Fort Road area. [SS] Fort Road was a historic Native American and fur trader path along the Mississippi River from downtown Saint Paul to Fort Snelling. [PP] [SS] Pike Island, Dakota name Wita Tanka, is an island at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers in the southwestern part of Saint Paul in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, U.S.. [SS] The island is now part of Fort Snelling State Park. [SS] It is a portion of the 100000 acre of land purchased from the Mdewakanton Sioux Indians by Zebulon Pike in September 1805. [SS] Pike's Purchase was later to become Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, and Saint Paul. [SS] The U.S. government wanted to build a fort to protect American interests in the fur trade in the region, and Pike negotiated the treaty. [SS] Pike valued the land at $200,000, but the U.S. Senate later agreed to pay only $2000. [PP] [SS] Fort Snelling State Park is a state park of Minnesota, USA, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. [SS] Its most notable feature is the historic Fort Snelling, which dates from 1820. [SS] The fort itself is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society and requires a separate entrance fee. [SS] The bulk of the state park preserves the bottomland forest, rivers, and backwater lakes below the river bluffs. [SS] The park was opened in 1962. [SS] Both the State Park and Historic Fort are part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service site.

{"question_id": "5ac43ddf5542995c82c4ad08", "answer": "water in the pipe preventing the passage of anything from the other direction. [SS] The device is a large clay U-bend with air-inlets and vents at the top. [SS] It is located below the ground level, but can be accessed through the air-inlet and a rodding hole. [SS] This hole allows drain rods to unblock anything located at the bottom of the U-bend. [PP] [SS] A trap primer (or trap seal primer) is a plumbing device or valve that adds water to traps. [SS] The water seals in traps are needed to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings, but because this water is exposed to the air, it is subject to evaporation over time in infrequently used floor drains, leading to the release of sewer gas into the environment. [SS] The trap primer mitigates this problem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to maintain the water seal indefinitely. [PP] [SS] Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance; equivalently, it is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of a reference substance for the same given volume. [SS] \"Apparent\" specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance. [SS] The reference substance is nearly always water at its densest (4C) for liquids; for gases it is air at room temperature (25C). [SS] Nonetheless, the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. [SS] Pressure is nearly always 1 atm (101.325 kPa). [SS] Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. [SS] In British beer brewing, the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1000. [SS] Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of [PP] [SS] Maekawa's theorem is a theorem in the mathematics of paper folding named after Jun Maekawa. [SS] It relates to flat-foldable origami crease patterns and states that at every vertex, the numbers of valley and mountain folds always differ by two in either direction. [SS] The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin and, even earlier, by S. Murata. [PP] [SS] The Pieterpad is a long distance walking route in the Netherlands. [SS] The trail runs 498 km from Pieterburen, in the northern part of Groningen, south through the eastern part of the Netherlands to end just south of Maastricht, on the top of Mount Saint Peter (\"St Pietersberg\"), at a height of 109 m . [SS] The Pieterpad is one of the official Long Distance Paths in the Netherlands (Lange Afstand Wandelpad Nummer 9) and by far the most popular of its long distance walking routes. [SS] It is possible to walk the route in either direction, and throughout the year. [SS] It is well signposted, and is well served by public transport and accommodation throughout its length. [SS] The official guide book is in two volumes, Pieterburen-Vorden and Vorden-Maastricht. [SS] A dedicated website (in Dutch) also [SS] [PP] [SS] A Tapsel gate is a type of wooden gate, unique to the English county of Sussex, which has a central pivot upon which it can rotate through 90 in either direction before coming to a stop at two fixed points. [SS] It was named after a Sussex family of bell-founders, one of whom invented it in the late 18th century. [SS] Only six examples survive, all within a 10 mi radius of Lewes, the county town of Sussex. [SS] Tapsel gates have the dual advantage of keeping cattle out of churchyards and allowing the efficient passage of coffins carried to and from the church during burials. [SS] The name sometimes is used more generally to describe swivelling gates of a similar design elsewhere. [PP] [SS] In plumbing, a trap is a device which has a shape that uses a bending path to capture water", "answer_confidence": 0.40909409523010254, "supporting_paragraphs": ["Trap (plumbing)", "Buchan trap"], "supporting_sentences": [["Buchan trap", 3], ["Trap (plumbing)", 0]]}

{"question_id": "5ab7f2d05542993667794064", "answer": "odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour). [SS] The variety has been referred to as \"the swimming cat\", and observed to swim in Lake Van. [PP] [SS] Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a broad term that is used to cover a number of conditions associated with the feline lower urinary tract. [SS] It may present as any of a variety of problems such as, inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) or urethra, formation of urinary crystals/stones in the bladder (crystalluria/urolithiasis), and partial or total obstruction of the urethra. [SS] The latter condition is also known as plugged-penis syndrome. [SS] Complete urethral obstruction is fatal if left untreated. [PP] [SS] Feline cystitis is associated with feline urological syndrome, feline lower urinary tract disease, and feline idiopathic cystitis. [SS] Feline cystitis means \"inflammation of the bladder\". [SS] The term \"idiopathic\" translates to unknown cause. [SS] This is because the direct cause of feline cystitis is unknown; however, certain behaviors have been known to aid the illness once it has been initiated. [SS] It can affect both males and females of any breed of cat. [SS] It is more commonly found in females cats; however, when males do exhibit cystitis, it is usually more dangerous. [PP] [SS] Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by \"feline herpesvirus 1\", of the family \"Herpesviridae\". [SS] It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition. [SS] Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats, FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide. [SS] The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is \"feline calicivirus\". [PP] [SS] In Hinduism, Budhi Pallien (pronounced BOO-dee PAL-ee-en) is a fearsome goddess of forests and jungles, who roams northern India, particularly Assam, in the form of a tiger. [SS] This wise goddess can change shape, from human to feline form and often travels with a companion tiger as she protects animals, with which she communicates. [PP] [SS] Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), also known as feline infectious enteritis, feline parvoviral enteritis, feline distemper, feline ataxia, or cat plague, is a viral infection affecting cats, both domesticated and wild feline species. [SS] It is caused by feline parvovirus, a close relative of both type 2 canine parvovirus and mink enteritis. [SS] Once contracted, it is highly contagious and can be fatal to the affected cat. [SS] The name panleukopenia comes from the low white blood cell count (leucocytes) exhibited by affected animals. [PP] [SS] Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease that affects cats. [SS] It is caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which is a mutation of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Feline coronavirus FCoV). [SS] Experts do not agree on the specifics of genetic changes that produce the FIPV. [SS] The mutated virus has the ability to invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages. [SS] The immune system's response causes an intense inflammatory reaction in the containing tissues. [SS] This disease is generally fatal. [SS] However, its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5,000 for households with one or two cats. [SS] A nasally administered vaccine for FIP is available but controversial, and it is not proven to be highly effective. [SS] An experimental polyprenyl immunostimulant is being manufactured by Sa [SS] [PP] [SS] Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. [SS] The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending on the origin of the condition: Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called \"juvenile diabetes\", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. [SS] The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. [SS] Dogs can have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. [SS] Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type [SS] [PP] [SS] An odd-eyed cat", "answer_confidence": 0.5190713405609131, "supporting_paragraphs": ["Odd-eyed cat", "Van cat"], "supporting_sentences": [["Van cat", 0], ["Van cat", 1], ["Odd-eyed cat", 0], ["Odd-eyed cat", 1]]}

{"question_id": "5a7aa2a255429941d65f270e", "answer": "Mikael Stanne (born 20 May 1974) is the vocalist & one of the lyricists (also previously rhythm guitarist) for the Swedish melodic death metal band, Dark Tranquillity and the ex-vocalist for Swedish power metal band HammerFall. [PP] [SS] High Rise is the first studio EP by American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released on October 8, 2013 through Play Pen, LLC. [SS] It is the first release by the band without former lead vocalist Scott Weiland, who was fired from the band in February 2013. [SS] It instead features Chester Bennington of Linkin Park on lead vocals, and the band is credited on the EP as \"Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington\". [SS] However, this would prove to be the sole release to feature Bennington before his departure from the band in 2015 and death in 2017. [PP] [SS] The Gallery is the second full-length studio album by the Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity, released on November 27, 1995. [SS] It was the first full-length release to feature Mikael Stanne. [PP] [SS] \"Talking to Myself\" is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. [SS] The song is the second single from their seventh studio album, \"One More Light\" and was released on July 25, 2017. [SS] The music video was released on July 20, 2017, the same day that Linkin Park's lead vocalist, Chester Bennington, was found dead by suicide. [SS] It is Chester Bennington's first posthumously released single. [PP] [SS] Skydancer is the debut studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band, Dark Tranquillity. [SS] This release was the last recorded output to feature vocalist Anders Fridn, later of In Flames, who was fired and replaced by then rhythm guitarist, Mikael Stanne. [SS] Incidentally, Mikael Stanne was the lead vocalist on the first In Flames studio album, \"Lunar Strain\". [PP] [SS] Damage Done is the sixth full-length studio album by the Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity. [SS] Here, the band returns to a more classic style while holding the new changes made in their albums \"Haven\" and \"Projector\", especially in the keyboards, but this is the first record since \"Projector\" that does not feature clean vocals. [SS] Martin Henriksson started doing some \"lead guitar riffs\" on the record, so the band showed influences from \"The Gallery\" in the duality of lead guitars. [SS] Mikael Stanne said that the lyrics on this album are about the frailty of life. [PP] [SS] The Hunting Party Tour was the eleventh concert tour by American alternative metal band Linkin Park. [SS] It was launched in support of Linkin Park's sixth studio album, \"The Hunting Party\" (2014). [SS] The tour was partially announced in May 2014 through a teaser released after the release of trailer of a co-headlined tour \"Carnivores Tour\" by Linkin Park and Thirty Seconds to Mars. [SS] Later, the tour was officially announced on November 23 with a whole trailer in promotion. [SS] Its first leg under the name \"European Tour\" began on May 30, 2014, in Lisboa, Portugal, and ended on June 14 in Castle Donington, England, where they played \"Hybrid Theory\" as a whole album. [SS] The tour features special guests Of Mice & Men and Rise Against.

{"question_id": "5a74c1c05542996c70cfadd8", "answer": "Betsy Ross Bridge, also known as the Ross Memorial Bridge is a continuous steel truss bridge spanning the Delaware River from the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania to Pennsauken, New Jersey. [SS] Built from 1969 to 1974, and opened in April 1976, during the American Bicentennial Year, it was originally planned to be named as the \"Delair Bridge\", after a paralleling vertical lift bridge owned by Pennsylvania Railroad (which is now used by Conrail and New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line), but was instead later named for Betsy Ross, a Philadelphia seamstress and reputed creator of the first American flag in 1776, making it the first automotive bridge named for a woman in America and the second bridge overall (after Iowa's Boone High Bridge was renamed the Kate Shelley High Bridge in 1912). [PP] [SS] The Delaware RiverTurnpike Toll Bridge is a four-lane, steel, arch-shaped, continuous truss bridge that connects the Pennsylvania Turnpike's East-West Mainline with the main trunk of the New Jersey Turnpike, via the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension (formerly known as the Pennsylvania Extension). [SS] The bridge crosses the Delaware River, connecting Bristol Township, Pennsylvania and Burlington Township, New Jersey. [SS] The bridge was closed to traffic on January 20, 2017, after a crack was discovered in a steel truss; it reopened on March 9 of that year. [PP] [SS] Interstate 295 (abbreviated I-295) in New Jersey and Delaware is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, designated as a bypass around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [SS] The route begins at a junction with I-95 south of Wilmington, Delaware, and runs to another junction with I-95 north of Trenton, New Jersey. [SS] The highway heads east from I-95 and crosses the Delaware River from Delaware to New Jersey on the Delaware Memorial Bridge concurrent with U.S. Route 40 (US 40). [SS] Upon entering New Jersey, the two routes split and I-295 runs parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike for most of its course in the state. [SS] After a concurrency with US 130 in Gloucester County, I-295 has an interchange with I-76 and Route 42 in Camden County. [SS] The freeway continues northeast toward Trenton, where it intersects I-195 and Route 29 before bypassing the city to the east and ending at US 1 in [PP] [SS] Simeon Willis Memorial Bridge is a bridge constructed in 1985 over the Ohio River connecting Winchester Ave. (US 23) and 13th St. (US 60) at Ashland, Kentucky to US 52 at Coal Grove, Ohio. [SS] It is named for Kentucky Governor Simeon S. Willis. [SS] The bridge was planned, at one point, to cross at 45th St. and connect to a proposed Ashland bypass. [SS] The Willis bridge, however, was built one block from the existing Ben Williamson Memorial Bridge and generally carries only Ohio-bound traffic. [SS] Southbound traffic, which is normally carried on the Williamson Bridge, was diverted to the Willis Bridge in early 2007 so that the Williamson Bridge could be repaired and painted. [SS] The Williamson Bridge was also closed briefly and traffic again diverted to the Willis Bridge in the summer of 2013 after a tractor-trailer ran into the tower on the Ohio side. [PP] [SS] The Nevius Street Bridge once carried car traffic across the Raritan River between Hillsborough Township and Raritan Borough in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. [SS] In the 1840s a wooden bridge crossed at this location. [SS] The current 150 ft bridge was built in 1886 by the Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio. [SS] It is a double intersection Pratt truss bridge. [SS] The construction of the nearby John Basilone Veterans Memorial Bridge replaced the Nevius Street Bridge in 2005; the bridge now serves as a pedestrian bridge, connecting River Road in Hillsborough with the Raritan River Greenway. [SS] Joannes Nevius was born in Zoelen, Netherlands, in 1627 and emigrated to New Amsterdam in 1651. [SS] His grandson, Petrus or Peter Nevius, was the first with the Nevius name to come to the Raritan Valley in Somerset County. [PP] [SS] The New Jersey Turnpike (NJTP), colloquially known to New Jerseyans as \"the Turnpike\", is a toll road in New Jersey, maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. [SS] According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Turnpike is the nation's sixth-busiest toll road and is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the United States. [SS] Having a total length of 122.40 mi , the Turnpike's southern terminus begins at Interstate 295 (I-295) near the border of Pennsville and Carneys Point Townships in Salem County, one mile east of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. [SS] Its northern terminus is located at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, Bergen County. [SS] The Turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey, as well as Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. [SS] The route divides into four roadways between exit 6 and exit 14, with [PP] [SS] Veteran's Memorial Bridge is a bridge connecting the cities of Portland, Maine and South Portland, Maine. [SS] The bridge spans the Fore River and is part of U.S. Route 1. [SS] The original Veteran's Memorial Bridge was built in 1954 and was described as 'rapidly deteriorating' prior to its demolition. [SS] Designated a top infrastructure priority by Maine state government, a new bridge was built beginning in 2010. [SS] The new bridge was completed on November 30, 2012. [SS] General contractor Reed & Reed of Woolwich, Maine was awarded the rebuilding contractor. [SS] Reed & Reed estimated the new bridge would stand for 100 years.

{"question_id": "5ac1b95655429963665198fd", "answer": "Little Boy\" was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress \"Enola Gay\", piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces. [SS] It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. [SS] The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history, after the Trinity test, and the first uranium-based detonation. [SS] It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 ktonTNT . [SS] The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima and its occupants. [PP] [SS] The Children's Peace Monument ( , Genbaku no Ko no Z , lit. [SS] \"Atomic Bomb Children Statue\") is a monument for peace to commemorate Sadako Sasaki and the thousands of child victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. [SS] This monument is located in Hiroshima, Japan. [SS] Sadako Sasaki, a young girl, died of leukemia from radiation of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. [PP] [SS] Hiroshima is a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Hersey. [SS] It tells the stories of six survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, covering a period of time immediately prior to and one year after the atomic bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945. [SS] It was originally published in \"The New Yorker\". [SS] Although the story was originally scheduled to be published over four issues, the entire edition of August 31, 1946, was dedicated to the article. [SS] The article and subsequent book are regarded as one of the earliest examples of the New Journalism, in which the story-telling techniques of fiction are adapted to non-fiction reporting. [PP] [SS] Vice Admiral Frederick Lincoln \"Dick\" Ashworth (24 January 1912 3 December 2005) was a United States Navy officer who served as the weaponeer on the B-29 \"Bockscar\" that dropped a Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan on 9 August 1945 during World War II. [PP] [SS] Jacob Beser (May 15, 1921 June 16, 1992) was a lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces who served during World War II. [SS] Beser was the radar specialist aboard the \"Enola Gay\" on August 6, 1945, when it dropped the Little Boy atomic bomb on Hiroshima. [SS] Three days later, Beser was a crewmember aboard \"Bockscar\" when the Fat Man bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. [SS] He was the only person to have served as a strike crew member of both of the 1945 atomic bomb missions. [PP] [SS] Two Bombs, One Satellite (Chinese:) was an early nuclear and space project of the People's Republic of China. [SS] \"Two Bombs\" refers to the Atomic bomb (and later the Hydrogen bomb) and Intercontinental Missile, while \"One Satellite\" refers to artificial satellites. [SS] China tested its first atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb in 1964 and 1967 respectively, while in 1970 the country successfully launched its first satellite (DFH-1). [SS] 23 scientists involved in the project was awarded the title \"Two bombs and one Satellite Award\" (Chinese:) in 1999. [PP] [SS] Morris Richard Jeppson (June 23, 1922 March 30, 2010) was a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. [SS] He served as assistant weaponeer on the \"Enola Gay\", which dropped the first atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. [PP] [SS] Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive power from nuclear fission or combined fission and fusion reactions. [SS] Starting with scientific breakthroughs made during the 1930s, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada collaborated during World War II in what was called the Manhattan Project to counter the suspected Nazi German atomic bomb project. [SS] In August 1945, two fission bombs were dropped on Japan, standing to date as the only use of nuclear weapons in combat. [SS] The Soviet Union started development shortly thereafter with their own atomic bomb project, and not long after that both countries developed even more powerful fusion weapons known as \"hydrogen bombs\".
